# connect4
Connect Four is a variation of tic-tac-toe played on a rectangular board. Typically there are 6 rows and 7  columns, although your code will work for any number of rows and columns. The game is played by two players, alternating turns, with each trying to place four checkers in a row  vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Because the board stands vertically and the checkers are subject to  gravity, a checker may only be placed at the top of one of the currently existing columns (or it may start a  new column).
